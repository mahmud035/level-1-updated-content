## Overview

The Job Portal Server API is designed to manage and serve job listings, facilitate job searching and filtering, provide user authentication, and enable recruiters to post job openings. This API is consumed by the Job Portal client to provide a seamless experience to users and recruiters.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Register and log in with JWT-based authentication.
- **Job Management**: Create, update, delete, and fetch job listings.
- **Search and Filter**: Advanced search by job title, location, and salary range.
- **Pagination**: Retrieve job listings with support for pagination.
- **Recruiter Functions**: Recruiters can manage their posted job listings.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for backend development.
- **Express**: Web framework to handle API requests and routing.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing job listings and user data.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: For user authentication and securing routes.
- **Zod**: For data validation and schema enforcement.
- **Axios**: For handling HTTP requests from the client.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the backend locally:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mahmud035/Level-1-Updated-Content.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the server directory:

   ```bash
   cd Level-1-Updated-Content/0.Conceptual Sessions/Batch-10/Milestone-11/Backend with JWT and Axios Interceptor/server
   ```

3. Install the necessary dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Set up environment variables in a `.env` file:

   ```bash
   NODE_ENV = 'development'
   PORT = 5000

   DATABASE_URI = 'Your database uri'
   DATABASE_NAME = 'Your database name'

   ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET = 'your-secret-key'
   ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRES_IN = 'token expires time'
   REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET = 'your-secret-key'
   REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRES_IN = 'token expires time'
   ```

5. Start the server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

The server will be running on `http://localhost:5000`.
